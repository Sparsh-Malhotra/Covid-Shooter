## Game Play

Covid Shooter is a single player arcade game in which the player has to get past all the obstacles in her way and reach to the end without being hit by Covid-19 virus guns else her health will reduce. There will be collectibles in the game levels such as injections, Bullets and Masks which will help the player to be alive. If a player dies, he can restart the level.

The controls for each player are as follows:

        Left:              Left Arrow
        Right:             Right Arrow
        Jump:              Up Arrow
        Shoot:             SPACE
        Throw Injection:   Q
